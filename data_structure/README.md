## Binary Search Tree

### Check valid tree

In the Solution class, we are trying to find if the given root note of a tree is
a valid Binary Search Tree (BST).

We will use recursion for this approach which may go through all the node of the
tree and check if the tree still satisfy the condition of BST. (A null node is
considered to be valid in BST.)

 - Space Complexity : O(n)
